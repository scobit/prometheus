# One option to help secure our Prometheus server is to put it behind a reverse proxy so that we can later add SSL and an Authentication 
# layer over the default unrestricted Prometheus web interface.

# We can use Nginx
sudo apt install nginx

# cd to the Nginx sites-enabled folder
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

# Create a new Nginx configuration for Prometheus
vim prometheus

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name  YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME;

    location / {
        proxy_pass           http://localhost:9090/;
    }
}

# test the new configuration has no errors
nginx -t

# Restart Nginx
sudo service nginx restart
sudo service nginx status

# Test it by visiting again http://YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME
# Visiting your ip address directly will still show the default Nginx welcome page. 
# If you don't want this to happen, then you can delete it's configuration using the command below.
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
