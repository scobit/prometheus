I have gone onto my domain name provider, and added an A Name record that points to the IP address of my new Prometheus server.

Example

prometheus.sbcode.net. IN A 134.209.224.39

note that it may take some time for the DNS record to propagate across the internet.

Purchasing A Domain
If you don't have a domain name, and your colleagues can't lend you one or even create a subdomain for you, then you can get cheap domains from Namecheap

Use the Domain Name Search Tool and try anything. The cheapest domains at the moment are the .xyz and .website domains.

Namecheap also has an advanced DNS config tool which allows you to create subdomains. The @ symbol in the image below is an alias for the main domain that is being managed.
