We will now add transport encryption to the Prometheus web user interface.

Since I have already set up the domain name, I can get a free certificate using Certbot.

Certbot will install a LetsEncrypt SSL certificate for free.

Ensure your domain name has propagated before running CertBot.

Your domain and IP will be different than mine, and note that it may take some time for the DNS record to propagate across the internet.

On my server, I will run

sudo snap install --classic certbot

Now we can run CertBot.


sudo certbot --nginx

Follow the prompts and select the domain name I want to secure.

Next open the Nginx Prometheus config file we created earlier to see the changes.


sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/prometheus
